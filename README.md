# keyboard
This is a repository for my keyboard project. Hardware design and 3D design are both self-taught, so the first designs might leave something to be desired.

## Motivation
The motivation behind making my own keyboard was the fact that I didn't have a keyboard. And I wanted a keyboard :) In retrospect buying a keyboard would actually have been quite a lot cheaper, however there was a specific feature I wanted in my keyboard. This feature relates to the use of the thumb. In normal keyboard both thumbs are primarily used on a single button, namely the space bar. This seems a tad wasteful considering the impressive dexterity of the thumb. When using our phones on the other hand we use the thumbs for the entire keyboard. Furthermore the thumbs are pressed down sideways when pressing the space bar. A more natural usage of the thumb is pressing it inward toward the hand. This is not easily achieved in a normal keyboard, but one can take inspiration from mouses with thumb buttons. As these utilize the thumb in a more natural way without compromising the other fingers. The goal with this project is to make a keyboard that utilizes the entire hand in an efficient and comfortable way. Mostly this will entail creating a design with a natural responsability and usage of the thumb, while keeping standard usage of the rest of the hand.

## v1
This is a onehanded ergonomical hotswappable mechanical keyboard. Lots of nice adjectives, but the onehanded part is the most important. The result turned out a little bit clunky and a little unpolished, but it got the job done. More details in the dedicated folder.

## v2
Intended Additions/improvements are: backlighting, integrated microcontroller, more comfortable design, better looking design.
